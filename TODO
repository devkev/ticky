DONE - how often does the website call batch/ to refresh?  how does it find out about updates?
DONE   - as expected, it receives a message on the websocket to tell it to sync, and then it syncs
DONE   - websocket is wss://wss.ticktick.com/web
DONE     - not sure about credentials - seems to use standard websocket key mechanism, but not sure where the key comes from
DONE       - there is no creds to open the wss
DONE       - on connection, the server sends a message with a uuid
DONE       - the website then takes this uuid and sends it as:
DONE             { pushToken: "06ade7fffe92700b-00004752-03bcac35-53d934d97d27e034-571aa7ff", osType: 41}
DONE         to POST https://api.ticktick.com/api/v2/push/register
DONE         and gets response
DONE             {"id":"31a33452b3414eab8dec761234ee8e5a","pushToken":"06ade7fffe92700b-00004752-03bcac35-53d934d97d27e034-571aa7ff","osType":41,"version":3880}
DONE         where the id changes each time
DONE     - there are hello message sent to the wss server periodically, probably to prevent connection timeout
DONE   - seems like it also just polls for no reason every 10 mins

DONE - how to demo this - lorem ipsum substitutions?!

- being able to quickly add a new entry to today's inbox

- being able to easily move items between days, eg. from yesterday (or earlier) to today

- being able to quickly mark tasks as done
